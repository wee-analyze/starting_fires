Spark 2.1, Python 2.7

I completed an online course on Udemy called Taming Big Data with Spark and Python. The were the scripts that we used. The course
covered RDD, various methods, an RDD algorithm from scratch, Sparksql, and mllib. I also included a Zeppelin notebook 
of the stuff covered in Sparksql.

I have altered the scripts in the course so that they work on an actual Spark cluster using HDFS instead of locally on a computer.
