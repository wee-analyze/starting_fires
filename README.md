Spark 2.1, Python 2.7

I completed an online course on Udemy called Taming Big Data with Spark and Python. These were the scripts that we used
which also includes scripts that I made myself. The course covered RDD, various methods, a recommendation algorith using RDD's 
which is made from scratch, Sparksql, and mllib.

I have altered the scripts in the course so that they work on an actual Spark cluster using HDFS instead of locally on a computer.
